Diploma thesis aims to analyze existing scripting languages and suggest new universal console interface, that aims focus on administrative tasks. Paper first analyze operating systems, existing scripting languages as well as emulators, which provides functionality of platform specific languages to other platforms. Paper also looks on ways how source code is translated to bytecode, which is later on run on \gls{pc}. In the next part of paper look on desing patterns, which will be used during creating of application,and  enable us to write more readable, maintainable and modifiable code. The output of work is fully functional administrative interface, which can be easily extended by plugins, which allow us to work in interactive as well as in scripting mode, on different operating systems which are supported by  \gls{jvm} as well as set of interfaces, which can be implemented to create new plugins for the administrative interface.
